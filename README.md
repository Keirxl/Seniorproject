This Python program takes user generated ratings of fourteen attractions in Philadelphia and, using those ratings as prizes,
writes the resulting Prize Collecting Traveling Salesman Problem formulation in a text file to be copied and pasted in LPsolve. 
This program creates an optimal tour based on the ratings of the user.
The time between attractions via public transport and a guess at the average time spent at each attraction are held in a matrix
at the top of the program. This data was taken using Google maps.
